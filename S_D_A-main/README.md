# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** is one of the core SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It states that a class should have **only one reason to change**, meaning it should have only **one responsibility** or **one job**.

## Why is SRP Important?

- **Simplicity**: Classes that focus on a single responsibility are easier to understand.
- **Maintainability**: If a class has only one job, changes to that job donâ€™t affect unrelated areas of the code.
- **Reusability**: A class that does one thing well can be reused in different contexts.
- **Testability**: Single responsibility classes are easier to test since they only deal with one concern.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a restaurant:
- The **chef** is responsible for cooking.
- The **cashier** is responsible for handling payments.

If one person tries to do both jobs, it can lead to confusion and inefficiency. Similarly, in programming, a class should focus on one specific task. If a class tries to do too much, it becomes harder to manage and modify.
