User Service - Smart Traveling System
This is a basic RESTful API for managing user data, allowing the creation of users, updating their real-time location, and retrieving their location. The service is built using Spring Boot and stores user information in memory with a simple Map structure. The system supports the following features:

Create User: Add a new user by specifying userID, name, and email.
Update Location: Update a user's location by providing latitude and longitude.
Get Location: Retrieve the current location (latitude and longitude) of a user.
This application demonstrates a simple microservice architecture for real-time user location management.
